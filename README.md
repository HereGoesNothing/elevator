elevator
========

Yet another attempt at an elevator MVC web-app repository using grails domain classes.

As Winston Churchill once said "Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." and "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."
Well we sure have had a lot of failures along the way with this project and if it were to continue, a few more to add.

Originally started some time back we scrapped it and restarted it as "IEMS" and then "elevator2" before returning back with something we felt we hand in under the original "elevator" title again!

We have documented a lot of these hiccups in the Wiki, so if you have time to kill and thinking about doing an MVC application there maybe a few mistakes we made that may save you a little time.

Thanks for taking the time to look.
